# rprint

rprint (or Re1ssPrint) is a custom print function for C. Its main purpose was to create a more efficient alternative to the standard library's printf. 

## Why ?

First of all, it's fun. I just love learning new things.<br>
Secondly i wanted to test something, is **printf** the best ?<br>

## Conclusion

* Tested CPU : i7-7700K
* Tested Terminal : kitty 0.42.2
* Tested Shell : bash 5.3.3
* Tested WM : Hyprland 0.50.1 (Wayland)
* Total Prints (for both) : 100.000

I tried to run it on tty too... But the performance wasn't stable.

Approximately rprint is 1.257 times faster than printf. (10 Tests)

I don't really know if i'm going to develop this project.<br>
I did it cuz it came to my mind and it's fun...<br>
So... yeah you can check the code, and learn some things.<br>
Maybe i will develop this project in the future...<br>
